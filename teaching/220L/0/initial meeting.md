### Attendance

- maximum of 3 unexcused absenses *subject to change*
- Three days notice required for students to attend different sections

### Shifts
- Every student needs to sign up for 30 minute shift, instead of the whole lab
  - up to 5 students per shift
- Showing up to shift counts as attendance
- Work assigned 6 days before actual lab, and due the day of lab
  - If they show up to their shift and *don't* get 100%, they get an extra day to work on the lab
