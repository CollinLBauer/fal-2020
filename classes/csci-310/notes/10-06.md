## Divide and Conquer

A **divide and conquer** algorithm is any algorithm which solves a problem by recursively splitting itself into smaller and smaller parts.

*Examples*
- MergeSort
- QuickSort

### Master Theorem
- If f(n) ∈ Θ(n<sup>d</sup>) where d >= 0 in the recurrence relation, then:  
  |T(n) ∈||
  |-|-|
  | Θ(n<sup>d</sup>) | if a < b<sup>d</sup> |
  | Θ(n<sup>d</sup>log(n)) >| if a = b<sup>d</sup> |
  | Θ(n<sup>log<sub>b</sub>a</sup>) | if a > b<sup>d</sup> |
