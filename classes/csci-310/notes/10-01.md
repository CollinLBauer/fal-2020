Assignments 2 and 3 posted
- 2 is due October 9th (ch. 4 & 5)
- 3 is due October 11th
- assignments are closely related to each other, apparently
- all the problems are from the book

Mid-term preamble
1. complete 4.4 and 4.5 (first reading) today
2. complete 5.1 and 5.2 (tuesday)
3. use thursday to tie loose ends (if any) and practice problems
4. Modifications in the Assignment 3 for problems from Chapter 5
5. Upload the Study-Outline for each chapter (excluding Chapter 5) for the midterm by Saturday noon. Study-Outline for Chapter 5 will be uploaded on Tuesday
6. Solutions of quizzes and Assignment-1 willk be uploaded on Sunday
7. Solution of Assignment-2 and Assignment-3 within 5 minutess after their deadlines
8. Addiitonal office hourse (next week): Monday 3-5PM and Friday 11AM-noon

We talk a bunch about binary search, how it works, and discussed the recurrence relation of it, and how to use that to find its order of growth
