## Bounds & Complexity

### Upper bound (Big-O)

### Lower bount (Big-Ω)

### Finding bounds w/ Limits

***L'hospital's Rule***
```
Lim    g(n)       ∞
      ------  =  ---
n → ∞  h(n)       ∞
```
or
```
Lim    g(n)       0
      ------  =  ---
n → ∞  h(n)       0
```

### Procedure for finding complexity
1. Select a paremeter for n (input size)
2. Identify the algorthm's basic operation (i.e. multiplication)
3. Check what other dependencies affect the number of executions of the basic operation (best, worst, average)
4. Set up sum expressing the number of times the algorithm's basic operation is executed
5. Find a closed formula or establish the order of growth
