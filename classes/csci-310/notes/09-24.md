## About Strong Induction...

From quiz 2...

> Prove by mathematical induction
> 
> 1² +2² + ... + n² = n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6

P(n) = 

Basic step
- P(1) = 1² = 1(1+1)(2⋅1+1) = 1⋅2⋅3/6 = 1


**Strong Induction Procedure**
1. Basic step
   - prove for n=1, that LHS = RHS
2. Inductive step
   - let n = some arbitrary number, *k*
   - Write out the problem for P(*k*) and assume it is true
   - Write out problem for P(k+1)
   - Use *inductive hypothesis*
     - LHS of P(k+1) = RHS of P(k) + last term of LHS
     - Algebraically solve for above RHS = RHS of P(k+1)

## Graph Traversal

Luckily i know most of this, so I can safely poop lol

...


### Decrease and Conquer
- Previous chapters focus on solving the full-sized problem
- Brute force: not efficient
- ?

...

**Correctness of Algorithms**
- Q: *What is it?*
  - a proof that shows the algorithm does what it should be doing.
  - Put differentlym tge algorithm construcst the expected output.
1. The properteis of the algorithm are valid before preconditions and postconditions
   - What does the precondiiton and postcondition mean?
   Loop invariant - it is a condition that is necessarily true before and after each iteration of a loop
