Second in-class thingy.

We're kinda expecting a pop quiz, but have no idea how it's going to go. So just pay sttention AND GET SOME PAPER READY

### Pre-class Algorithm - The *Highway Problem*

Given a path with tolls between two points, with interconnected subpaths, how do we choose a path such that we minimize the amount we pay in tolls?

### Next algorithm: The *Stable Roommates Problem*

## Brute Force Algorithms

***Brute Force*** is a straightforward approach to solving a problem, usually directly based on the problem statement and definitions of the concepts involved.
- The "force" implied by the strategy's definition is that of a computer and not that of one's intellect. Often, the brute force strategy is the easiest to apply.


### Brute force in terms of searching and sorting

Searching and sorting are two very commonly required algorithms. We know efficient algorithms for each, but studying their brute force, or "first idea" algorithms is important to understand their efficiency.

**Bubble Sort & Selection Sort**
