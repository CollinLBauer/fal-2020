First in-class attempt.

This is going to be awkward as hell.

He talked about studying 2.4. I'm not 100% sure what he's referring to, but I'm sure I wasn't paying attention when he originally assigned it last week, whether it was reading or an assingment.
Now, I *do* actually have some assignments that I need to do for this class. And I should read anyway, really. So...yeah.

## Recurrence Relaitons

### Example: **Tower of Hanoi**
- A number of disks in decreasing size sit around on one of three pegs
- The goal of the game is to move all of the disks from the first to the third peg, in the same order
- Only one disk may be moved at a time
- A larger disk may not be put on top of a smaller disk

Moves per disk count
- 5 disks takes 31 moves (per example)
- 4 disks? 15
- 3 disks? 7

By observation, we can construct the recurrence relation
- H(1) = 1
- H(n) = H(n - 1) + H(n - 1) + 1 for n > 1
  - Simplified: H(n) = 2H(n - 1) + 1 for n > 1

### Example: **Fibonacci Sequence**
- F(0) = 1
- F(1) = 1
- F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2) for n > 1


Read chapters 3.1 and 3.2
- *I guess that means read 2.4 you silly goof*
