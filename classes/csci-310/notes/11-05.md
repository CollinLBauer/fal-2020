Been a while since I've taken notes.


## Directed Graphs - "Digraphs"
- A graph where each edge points from one node to another
- Represented

Adjacent Matrix
- a matrix representation of edges
- if there is an 

Transitive Closure

Warshall's Algorithm
- Something about ANDing edges inn teh adjacency matrix with each other

George: *What's the time limit and number of questions?*
- I do not have a way to see if someone is creatively looking at notes...etc...while others are giving their honest effort
- Number of questions will be 4-5 and time will be 1 hour
- I may reduce the number of questions if I ask the details in the working.
