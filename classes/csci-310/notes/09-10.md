I woke up late today

Also, fuck Ghosh's examples. I'm just gonna read the book.

# Chapter 2 - Fundamentals of the Analysis of Algorithm Efficiency


## 2.1 Analysis Framework

Theree are two kinds of efficiency

***Time efficiency*** (or time complexity)
- describes how fast an algorithm runs.
- modern algorithms focus on time efficiency

***Space efficiency*** (or space complexity)
- describes how many memory units the algorithm requires in addition to its input and output.
- Note that space efficiency used to be amuch larger concern
