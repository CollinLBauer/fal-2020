### Projection
The **projection** operation works on a singgle relation R and defines a relation that contains a vertical subset of R, extracting the values of specified attributess and eliminating duplicates
- Format: Π<sub>a1,....,an</sub>(R)

***Example***: Produce a list of salaries for all staff, showing only the `staffNo`, `fName`, `IName`, and `salary` details.
- Π<sub>staffNo,fName,IName,salary</sub>(Staff)

Result:

|-|-|-|

### Selection
The **selection** operation works on a single relation R and defines a relation that contains only those tuples of R that satisfy the specified condition (*predicate*).
- Format: σ<sub>predicate</sub>(R)

***Example***: List all staff with a salary greater than $10,000
- σ<sub>salary > 10000</sub>(Staff)
