Idea:

In our readings, the narration is often framed (at least indirectly) as a man talking about a woman that he once loved, and the bulk of the story is in past tense. I'd like to take a dive into why this was a trend and what repercussions it had on future Russian writings.

I want to explore why there are these tendencies for these romantic tragedies to be told from a more removed perspective.

Questions to consider
- how far removed the narrator is
- time between events and story
- fault & consequences
- ultimately, why was this style chosen?
- BONUS: How does this removal affect the narration of the story? How would it change if the main character was the only narrator?
- BONUS: How/why do other authors use frame narrators?

minimum 6 pages

Writins with this framing:
