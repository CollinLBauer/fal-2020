Along the way, Ivan Vasilyevich found plenty to talk about. It was astonishing to me, sinve those two or tree times I had seen him before -- I think, at the priest's and the mayor's -- he had ben silent, stiff, and seemed to be sullen and unsociable man. In the small, remote distrct town where I came to spend about a month, he ahd been serving as the district police officer for something like ten years. I remember that, when I found this out, I immediately thought his sullenness was completely natural. Th elittle town was worse than any vollage: empty, dustry streets, slanting rows of overgrown, soft grass on the market square, gloomy huts surrounded by half-andy, half-swampy fields, not one garden, not one forest to be seen. The littke town immediately struck me as being offible, but we often judge by our own yard sitck and refuse to belive that something which seeens awful to us could possibly be otherwise in reality, or at least for some.

We were travelling by post -- I, to visit a friend on a distant estate; Ivan Vasilyevich, on business to the district town. We left at the same time, and since we were going the same way to the first station, Ivan Vasilyevich invited me to ride in his carriage.

"From Makarikha you will be able to travel faster, since the road there is a bit better," said Ivan Vasilyevich. "But here, before we reach Makarikha, you will probably be a bit bored. The distance is great -- twenty-six *versts*, and hte road passes through a forest. You probably already know what a lot of forest roads we have."

The road, for a number of *versts* actually did pass through a forest. There wer potholes, puddles from the fallen rain, thickly interlaced roots, and ssome other sorts of things -- not exactly stumps, nor rotten pickets, either. The forst road was indeed very interesting. We travelled on at a slow, constant pace. From the branches which bent toward us from both sides of the forste, thick and dark, there came a smell of freshness dampness, and hte strong, sharp pragrance of fir trees. The scen tof apples seemed to float in the air. The sun had not quite disappeared, and the sky, suffuse dwith its last light, was quietly turning from blue to gold. The solitary troika, with its bells dully ringing, cautiously drove on -- one moment thr driver would be engrossed in his thoughts, and the next, be dozing.

I looked to the side, close by, at Ivan Vasilyevich, at his white cap; now his face seemed to be absolutely free of moroseness, and only very serious -- one sometimes sees such simple solemnity. From under his cap his face appeared dark. He couild have been aobut fifty, or perhaps younger.

He was strong, heavy-set, and somewhat stiff. When he loked at me, I saw the same serious immobile simplicity in his brown eyes. He ahd an unusual wrinkle on his cheek: a long, deep furrow which extended from his eye down to the very middle of his face. It was as sharp as if someone had purposely marked him on his cheek. I noticed htat he never smiled, even when he talked cheerfully, as if these wrinkles didn't allow him to smile. In general, however, the face of Ivan Vasilyevich was very ordinary. I have difficulty recalling him now, either because I had seen him too many times, or had seen men who resembled him.

He didn't begin speaking at once. He would, however, answer my questions simply and willingly. Then suddenly he asked me:

"Have you heard of my misforutne?"

"You have . . . a sick wife, don't you?"

"Yes . . . She is in hte hospital in the provincial capital. The second year has gone by."

"The second year? What have the doctors said? Is there hope?"

"How can I say? Mental illness belong to an area ... that science knows little about. I can't get any definite answer. I know nothing."

He uttered these last words with such a strange expression that I raised my head.

"How is it that you know nothing? The type of illness is certainly known?"

"No . . . Neither the type of illness nor the cause is known. Even . . . of course, I admit this to you in a moment of weakness . . . but I don't hide it, such moments do occur . . . It seems to me that she's not mentall yill at all, and never has been."

"What! Then why did you commmit her to an insane asylum?"

"I didn't commit her . . . You must excuse me., I made a slip of the tongue; these are only momentary thoughts of mine. She is no stranger to me, you know. I know nothing about medicine. The doctors know better than I."

Although I saw that Ivan Vasilyevich himself desired to speak wiht me, to ask him any further questions was completely inappropriate, and I fell silent, waiting to hear what he would say.

He took off his cap, ran his hand throught his short hair, and, having slightly raised his heavy eyelids, glanced at me and all around. The road, as before, went through the woods. Night was falling and the twilight was such a quiet, fragrant, golden color!

"By now I've become accustomed to my sorrow," continued Ivan Vasilyevich. "Little by little one grows used to everything. Before, how hard it was to say anything more about it. How can you explain to someone else what you yourself don't really understand? It would seem to be quite simple -- and yet, in reality, it's not so simple at all. Howwever," he added in all seriousness, and with an almost indifferent simplicity, "most likely it's true; after all, she's not a stranger to me . . ."

I glanced at him, at the strange wrinkles on his cheeks, at his kind eyes, and I asked him to tell me from the beginning how this "misfortune" had occured. Here is what he told me.

## II
*p. 38 - 42*

"My wife, Vera ivanova, is now a bit over thirty. However, she looks much older -- thin, pale, her face dominated by dark brows. She married me when she was sixteen and a half; if only you could have seen how she was in bloom! Simply a beauty! She was, I must tell you, of a noble family; that is, her mother was an impoverished princess, an orphan who had married a minor official in our district town. I didn't know her. At the time that I met Vera Ivanova, her father had long been married a second time to a woman from a very simple family; they had many children, and Vera looked after them. In spite of this, she graduated from high school. They were poor; Very had no dowery, but it didn't matter to me -- I alreasdy had a position as an assistant in another district. I thought, somehow we would make a living. I liked Verya very much.

"As for myself,you see, I entered Kazan University; I had dreamed of another road, but I didn't finish my education. I was involve din an incident -- you know, in his you a man is hot-blooded and unreasonable, and our time was so peculiar . . . it wasn't a serious incident, yet I was expelled from the university. I can firmly say" -- here Ivan Vasilyevich glanced at me almost severely -- "that I have eremained true to my strong convicitions. Just as I was then -- I am now. Only my reasonableness, tenacity, and experience have increased. My sole belief is in humanity -- love of man, and strong, vital help to him who needs light and bread. Don't consider this a boast, because I'm not speaking of what I have done, but only of what I always believed in. My sister and I were also the children of a minor civil servant in Kazan'. When out parents died, my fsister became a village schoolteacher, and I entered the service of the district governmnet. For a long time I tormented myself over my entering the civil service, but then I understood how much good I could accomplish there. for three years my sister wouldn't associate with me, but then she, too, understood it. It was pretty hard at the beginning, and even now, at times, it isn't easy; howerver, waht a compairison one could make! Things change from year to year. Thirty or forty years ago a man such as mysel,f with my convictions, wouldn't have been tolerated for even one day, yet now I am held in the highest regard at the governor's. Yes, the principles of humanity and enlightenmnet are beginning to triumph. Everything is moving in that direction."

"Is that so?" I involuntarily challenged him.

"Yes, sir, it is. Haven't you noticed it yourself? You will se that it's true, if you speak wiht someone of higher rank. The wind is blowing in that direction. Mandkind is developing, and though progress is slow, culture, science, and knowledge are performing great wonders."

"That means you belive that men are ona straight path to universal happiness?" Again I didn't restrain mysel fand interruped him.

He raised his brows in surprise.

"How can it be otherwise? The straight path, perhasps, isn't smooth, and patience is still required . . . but all will develop of its own accord, and its own will. Think of it like this: Education spreads, superstitions are extinguished one after another; the intellect is developing, and with it a reasonable graitification of needs. And a respect for another's individuality in the name of the ideal of mankind."

I saw that this conversation could lead us far afield, and so I didn' voice my objections. Ivan Vasilyevich returned to our former discussion.

"And so, I married Verochka. Remembering back to that time, I can see that even there was something not entirely normal about her. There were no hystrics, nothing of that sort, but, as the doctors say, an aggravated sensitivity. I think that it was so even then. I loved her, I tell you truthfully, with all my soul. But she, to put it simply, was ecstatic all the time. She would continuously tell m ehow much she loved me -- so muchso that later she would be angry with herself.

"'I cannot express my love. I would like to, but I am unable to. Help me, if you have any pity for me.'

"I would calm her down.

"'This,' I would tell her, 'Verusha, is your romanticism. I know that you love me, and I am happy. What more could you want?' There was no reason to be surprised at her romanticism: after all, she wasn't quite seventeen years old, whereas I was no longer an innocent youth.

"However, she became angry at me more and more often. Then once she suddenly said:

"'You amuse yourse with me as though you were playing wiht a doll. I know nothing about you. Tell me, what do you think about?'

"This repraoch wounded me, since, after all, I am a just man. What could I do? She was such a young thing, and so pretty, and I was so in love with her. During this period after th wedding . . . I, of course, came ot my senses, and begged her pardon.

"'Just wait a bit, everything will come in time.'

"Then she pleaded: 'Give me some sort of work. I'm bored.'

"I was glad to do this. I saw that in time she would be  real woman -- and not only a woman, but a human being as well. But now she was such a child. And so again I said:

"'Wait a while, everything will work out. Take care of the household, of the apartmnet. Speak with good people, try to understand them. I will order some new books for you from St. Petersburg, and you read the old ones that I already have. You really should read them, too.'

"This was ll right with her, and she agreed. I travelled; she attended to the house.The litle town in which we lived was even worse than my present one. The location, however, was somewhat more pleasant; it was surrounded by a stream and some woods. I managed to find a nice apartmnet -- a new little house with trhee rooms -- like a dol's house. I introduced Vera to the wife of the archbishop and the wife of a member of the cour; you know how it is, the usual country society. They're very kind people. There were worse then, less educated, but now one might say that even in our town we have a marvelous society, all quite educated, and not apathetic.
