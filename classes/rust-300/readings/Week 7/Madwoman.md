Along the way, Ivan Vasilyevich found plenty to talk about. It was astonishing to me, sinve those two or tree times I had seen him before -- I think, at the priest's and the mayor's -- he had ben silent, stiff, and seemed to be sullen and unsociable man. In the small, remote distrct town where I came to spend about a month, he ahd been serving as the district police officer for something like ten years. I remember that, when I found this out, I immediately thought his sullenness was completely natural. Th elittle town was worse than any vollage: empty, dustry streets, slanting rows of overgrown, soft grass on the market square, gloomy huts surrounded by half-andy, half-swampy fields, not one garden, not one forest to be seen. The littke town immediately struck me as being offible, but we often judge by our own yard sitck and refuse to belive that something which seeens awful to us could possibly be otherwise in reality, or at least for some.

We were travelling by post -- I, to visit a friend on a distant estate; Ivan Vasilyevich, on business to the district town. We left at the same time, and since we were going the same way to the first station, Ivan Vasilyevich invited me to ride in his carriage.

"From Makarikha you will be able to travel faster, since the road there is a bit better," said Ivan Vasilyevich. "But here, before we reach Makarikha, you will probably be a bit bored. The distance is great -- twenty-six *versts*, and hte road passes through a forest. You probably already know what a lot of forest roads we have."

The road, for a number of *versts* actually did pass through a forest. There wer potholes, puddles from the fallen rain, thickly interlaced roots, and ssome other sorts of things -- not exactly stumps, nor rotten pickets, either. The forst road was indeed very interesting. We travelled on at a slow, constant pace. From the branches which bent toward us from both sides of the forste, thick and dark, there came a smell of freshness dampness, and hte strong, sharp pragrance of fir trees. The scen tof apples seemed to float in the air. The sun had not quite disappeared, and the sky, suffuse dwith its last light, was quietly turning from blue to gold. The solitary troika, with its bells dully ringing, cautiously drove on -- one moment thr driver would be engrossed in his thoughts, and the next, be dozing.

I looked to the side, close by, at Ivan Vasilyevich, at his white cap; now his face seemed to be absolutely free of moroseness, and only very serious -- one sometimes sees such simple solemnity. From under his cap his face appeared dark. He couild have been aobut fifty, or perhaps younger.

He was strong, heavy-set, and somewhat stiff. When he loked at me, I saw the same serious immobile simplicity in his brown eyes. He ahd an unusual wrinkle on his cheek: a long, deep furrow which extended from his eye down to the very middle of his face. It was as sharp as if someone had purposely marked him on his cheek. I noticed htat he never smiled, even when he talked cheerfully, as if these wrinkles didn't allow him to smile. In general, however, the face of Ivan Vasilyevich was very ordinary. I have difficulty recalling him now, either because I had seen him too many times, or had seen men who resembled him.

He didn't begin speaking at once. He would, however, answer my questions simply and willingly. Then suddenly he asked me:

"Have you heard of my misforutne?"

"You have . . . a sick wife, don't you?"

"Yes . . . She is in hte hospital in the provincial capital. The second year has gone by."

"The second year? What have the doctors said? Is there hope?"

"How can I say? Mental illness belong to an area ... that science knows little about. I can't get any definite answer. I know nothing."

He uttered these last words with such a strange expression that I raised my head.

"How is it that you know nothing? The type of illness is certainly known?"

"No . . . Neither the type of illness nor the cause is known. Even . . . of course, I admit this to you in a moment of weakness . . . but I don't hide it, such moments do occur . . . It seems to me that she's not mentall yill at all, and never has been."

"What! Then why did you commmit her to an insane asylum?"

"I didn't commit her . . . You must excuse me., I made a slip of the tongue; these are only momentary thoughts of mine. She is no stranger to me, you know. I know nothing about medicine. The doctors know better than I."

Although I saw that Ivan Vasilyevich himself desired to speak wiht me, to ask him any further questions was completely inappropriate, and I fell silent, waiting to hear what he would say.

He took off his cap, ran his hand throught his short hair, and, having slightly raised his heavy eyelids, glanced at me and all around. The road, as before, went through the
