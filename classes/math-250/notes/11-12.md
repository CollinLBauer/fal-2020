Hypothesis Tests for One Population Mean When *sigma* Is Known

### One-Mean z-Test
**Purpose**: To perform a hypothesis test for a population mean, *mu*

**Assumptions**
1. Simple random sample
2. Normal population or large sample
3. *sigma* kniwn

**Procedure**
1. The null hypothesis is H0: mu = mu0, and hte alternative hypothesis is ... *see 11-12a*
2. Decide on the significance level, *alpha*
3. Compute the value of the test statistic
4. choose: *see 11-12b.png*
   - *Critical-value approach*
   - *P-value approach*

*We talked about example 9.11, Taller Younger Women, from the book.*
