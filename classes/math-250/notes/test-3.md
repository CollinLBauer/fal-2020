​First, state the null and alternative hypotheses. The null hypothesis for a test concerning a population mean specifies a single value for that mean.

H0​: mu = 0.5 ppm
- *This becomes mu0*

The alternative hypothesis depends on the purpose of the test.
- If the primary purpose is deciding whether a population mean is different from a specified value ​, then the alternative hypothesis is: Ha: mu != mu0
- If the primary concern is deciding whether a population mean is less than a specified value ​, then the alternative hypothesis is: ​Ha: mu < mu0 
- If the primary concern is deciding whether a population mean is greater than a specified value ​, then the alternative hypothesis is: ​Ha: mu > mu0

*Look for a keyword: greater, less than, is not equal, etc*

Significance level could be stated as percent or decimal



One-mean Z test formula

        mean - null hypothesis
 Z =  -------------------------
               stddev
         ----------------
         sqrt(sample size)

x_bar   => mean
mu_0    => null hypothesis
sigma   => stddev
n       => sample size

## Critical Values

Critical value(s) to find depends on the form of the test
- greater than --> right-tailed test
  - reject if too large
- less than --> left-tailed test
  - reject if too small
- not equal --> two-tailed (I guess)
