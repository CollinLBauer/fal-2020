**Permutations**
- nPr(n,r) = n! / (n - r)!


**Combinations**
- nCr(n,r) = n!/(n-r)!r!
- Combinations may also be represented similarly to a vertex
  ```
  ╭  ╮
  │14│
  │ 6│ = 14c6
  ╰  ╯
  ```

Note that combinations and permutations are closely related
- nCr = nPr / r!
- *I dont think this will be relevant to the class, however...*
