### Binomial Probability Formula

Let X denote the total number of successes in *n* Bernoulli trials with such probability *p*. Then the probability distribution foi the random variable given by   

- P(X = x) = (n x) P<sup>x</sup>(1 - p)<sup>n - x</sup>, x = 0, 1, 2, ... n   

The random variable X is called a **binomial random variable** and is said to have the **biomial distribution** with parameters *n* and *p*

### Poisson Probability Formula

Probability for a random variable X that has a Poisson distribution are given by the formula:

- P(X = x) = *e*<sup>-λ</sup> * λ<sup>x</sup>/x!  
  - x is a nonnegative integer
  - λ is a positive real number
  - *e* = 2.718

The random variable X is called a **Poisson random variable** and is said to have the **Poisson distribution** with parameter λ.

***Procedure***
1. Find *n*, the number of trials, and *p*, the success probability.
2. Continue only if *n* >= 100 and *np* <= 10
3. Approximate the binomial probabilities by using the Poisson probability formula
   - When finding it this way, substitute λ with *np*

- Note that the total possion probability will always = 1.
- When finding distributions less than or greater than a given X, add up all possible values.
  - *For greater an a given X, find where it <= that value, then find the complement of 1.*
  - *Note that when finding when X < some number, you **must** include X = 0*

Lambda is the fucking mean, by the way.

Also, the standard deviation is the square root of lambda, apparently.

What the actual fuck.
