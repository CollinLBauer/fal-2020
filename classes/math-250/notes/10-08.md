### Binomial Probability Formula

Let X denote the total number of successes in *n* Bernoulli trials with such probability *p*. Then the probability distribution foi the random variable given by   

- P(X = x) = (n x) P<sup>x</sup>(1 - p)<sup>n - x</sup>, x = 0, 1, 2, ... n   

The random variable X is called a **binomial random variable** and is said to have the **biomial distribution** with parameters *n* and *p*

### Poisson Probability Formula

Probability for a random variable X that has a Poisson distribution are given by the formula

- P(X = x) e<sup>-位</sup> * 位<sup>x</sup>/x! , x = 0, 1, 2, ...

where 位 is a positive real number a e 2.718. The random variable X is called a **Poisson random variable** and is said to have the **Poisson distribution** with parameter 位.

***Procedure***
1. Find *n*, the number of trials, and *p*, the success probability.
2. Continue only if *n* >= 100 and *np* <= 10
3. Approximate the binomial probabilities by using the Poisson probability formula
