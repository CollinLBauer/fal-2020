## Experimental Designs

In an **observational study**, researchers simply observe characteristics and take measurements.

In a **designed experiment**, researchers impose treatments and controls, then observe characteristics and take mearurments,

Observational studies can only reveal *association*, while designed experiments can help establish *causation*.

Example: ***Vasectomies and Prostate Cancer***
> One study found 113 cases of prostate cancer among 22,000 men who had a vasectomy. This compares to a rate of 70 cases per 22,000 among men who didn’t have a vasectomy.” The study shows about a 60% elevated risk of prostate cancer for men who have had a vasectomy, thereby revealing an association between vasectomy and prostate cancer. But does it establish causation: that having a vasectomy causes an increased risk of prostate cancer?
- No, because the study was observational.

Example: ***Folic Acid and Birth Defects***
> For the study, the doctors enrolled 4753 women prior to conception and divided them randomly into two groups. One group took daily multivitamins containing 0.8 mg of folic acid, whereas the other group received only trace elements (minute amounts of copper, manganese, zinc, and vitamin C). A drastic reduction in the rate of major birth defects occurred among the women who took folic acid: 13 per 1000, as compared to 23 per 1000 for those women who did not take folic acid.
- This study helps establish causation.

## Organizing Data

<br/>

For the following examples, consider the data set:  
**Days to maturity for 40 sort-term investments**
| | | | | | | | |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| 70 | 64 | 99 | 55 | 64 | 89 | 87 | 65 |
| 62 | 38 | 67 | 70 | 60 | 69 | 78 | 39 |
| 75 | 56 | 71 | 51 | 99 | 68 | 95 | 86 |
| 57 | 53 | 47 | 50 | 55 | 81 | 80 | 98 |
| 51 | 36 | 63 | 66 | 85 | 79 | 83 | 70 |

<br/>

### Variable types
- ***Qualatative***
- ***Quantitative***
  - **Discrete** - only a finite number of possible values
  - **Continuous** - possible values form interval of numbers

<br/>

## Qualatiative data

### Frequency Distributions
A **frequency distribution** of qualitative data is a listing of the distinct values and their frequencies.

***Procedure: contruct a freequency distribution of qualitative data***
1. List the distinct values of the observations in the data set in the first column of a table.
2. For each oberservation, place a tally mark in the second column of the table in the row of the appropriate distince value.
3. Count the tallies for each distince value and record the totals in the third column of the table

### Relative Frequency
A **relative frequency** distribution...

***Procedure:***

*Fill in the gaps once he posts the Chapter 2 slides on Oaks*

### Pie Charts
A **pie chart** is...

***Procedure: Construct a pie chart***
1. Obtain a relative-frequency distribution of the data by applying the relative frequency 
2. Divide a disk into wedge-shaped pieces propoprtional to the relative frequencies
3. Label the slices witht he distinct values and their relative frequencies

### Bar Charts
A **bar chart** displays the *distinct values* of the qualitative data on a horizontal axis an dthe *relative frequencies* of those values on the vertical axis. The relative frquency of each distinct value is represented by a vertical bar whose height is equal to the relative frequency of that value. The bars should be positioned so that they do not touch each other.

*Weird distinction.*

***Procedure: Construct a bar chart***
1. Obtain a relative frequency idstribution of the data
2. Draw a horizontal axis on which to place the bars and avertical axis on which to display relative frequencies

## Quantitative Data

### Limit grouping
- **Lower class limit**: the smallest value that could go in a class
- **Upper class limit**: The largest values that could go in a class
- **Class width**: The diffrerence between the lower limit of a class and the lower limit of the next higher class
- **Class mark**: The average of the two class limits of a class

### Cutpoint Grouping
- **Lower class cutpoint**: The smallest value that could go in a class
- **Upper class cutpoint**: The largest alue that could go in the *next-higher* class
- **Class width**: The difference between the cutpoints of a class
- **Class midpoint**: The average of the two cutpoints of a class

*Add lecture 3 stuff here*

### Histogram

*Note: A histogram is similar to a bar chart, but for sqeuantial quantitative data grouped by cutpoint*

***Procedure***
1.
2.
3.
4. Label the bars with the classes as explained 

### Dotplot

**Procedure**
1. 
2. Record each obervation by placing a dot over the appropriate value on the horizontal axis
3. Label the horizontal axis with the name of the variable

### Stem-and-Leav diagrams
In a ***Stem-and-Leaf*** diagram (or ***stemplpt***), each obersvation is separated into two parts, nameley, a **stem**

***Procedure***
1. Think of each observation as a *stem* - consisting of all but the rightmost digit - and a *leaf*, the rightmost digit.
2. Write teh stems from smallest to largest ina  vertical column to the left of a vertical rule
3. Write each leaf to the right of the vertical rule in the row that conatins the appropriate stem
4. Arrange the leaves in each row in ascending order

```
Stems | Leaves
    3 | 6 8 9
    4 | 7
    5 | 0 1 1 3 5 5 6
    6 | 0 2 3 4 4 5 6 7 8 9
    7 | 0 0 0 1 5 8 9
    8 | 0 1 3 5 6 7 9
    9 | 5 8 9 9
```

### Distribution of a Data Set
The **distribution of a data set** is a table, graph, or formula yhtat provides the values of the oberservations and how often they occur.


### Modality
**Modality** describes the distribution groupings of a data set by the number of "peaks"
- Unimodal (one peak)
- Bimodal (two peaks)
- Multimodal (three or more peaks)
- Nomodal (no peaks)

### Dystribution symmetry

***Symmetric distributions***:
- bell-shaped
- triangular
- uniform/rectangular (straight line)

Skewed distributions:
- Right-skewed (higher rate on the *left* side; longer right tail)
- Left-skewed (higher rate on the *right* side; longer left tail)

Notes:
- A uniform distribution will always be nomodal.

### Misleading Graphs
- *Truncation* can lead to gaps appearing greater than they actually are
- *Improper scaling*, i.e. doubling width & height versus just height
